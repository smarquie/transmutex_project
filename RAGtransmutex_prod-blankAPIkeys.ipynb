      "Generated Answer: Based on the provided search results, here are the key points regarding corrosion experiments of various metals, with an emphasis on steel alloys, in liquid lead:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Corrosion Test Setup**: The corrosion tests were conducted using a thermally insulated stainless steel furnace designed to expose steels to stagnant liquid lead. The working crucible inside the furnace has a volume of approximately one liter (Results 1 and 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sample Types**: The experiments involved two types of 316L stainless steel samples: coated and uncoated. The coated samples had an alumina and NiCrAlY interlayer, while the uncoated samples were mechanically sanded using the same abrasive paper grades as the coated ones (Results 1 and 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Number of Samples**: A total of 9 samples were used in the tests: 5 coated 316L stainless steel samples and 4 uncoated 316L stainless steel specimens (Results 1 and 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Testing Conditions**: The corrosion tests were carried out in stagnant liquid lead at a temperature of 550°C (Results 1 and 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Duration of Tests**: The corrosion tests were performed for two different durations: 500 hours and 1000 hours (Result 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Pre-Test Preparation**: Before the corrosion tests, the uncoated samples were mechanically sanded on the same abrasive paper grades as the coated ones to ensure consistency in surface preparation (Results 1 and 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Analysis Techniques**: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses were used to examine the microstructure and thickness of the deposited layers on the samples. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analyses provided information about the elemental composition of the coatings (Result 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Installation System**: The installation system for the corrosion tests included specific setups for both coated and uncoated samples, as depicted in Figure 2 of the source material (Results 1 and 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Adhesion Examination**: The adhesion of the film on the coated samples was examined as part of the analysis process (Result 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Exposure Environment**: The corrosion tests were performed in an environment open to air, which could influence the oxidation and corrosion behavior of the samples (Result 3).\n",
